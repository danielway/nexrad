# NEXRAD Test Fixture Catalog
#
# This file documents curated test fixtures for the nexrad workspace.
# Each fixture is a trimmed (2-3 sweeps) NEXRAD Archive II volume file
# selected to cover diverse time periods, geographic regions, and weather regimes.
#
# Fixture files are stored in subdirectories by weather regime and loaded
# via include_bytes! in integration tests.
